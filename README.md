# CustomKeys
Quick and dirty hotkey script to run at startup. Adds shortcuts for formatting names and addresses.

File is .pyw so it runs windowless. Should be added to a startup folder.

Hotkeys are Lcontrol + Lwin + F1-3.
+F1: Takes the clipboard contents and formats so the first letters are capitalised, then copies the result to clipboard. Useful for names.
+F2: Takes the clipboard contents and formats so the first letters and last line are capitalised, then copies the result to clipboard. Useful for addresses.
+F3: Takes the clipboard contents and strips all caps, then copies the result to clipboard. Useful for weirdly-formatted website copy.
